data_analysis.py: Summerjob at UiO code. Messy as it was only created for me to use. Program takes a .fits file and superimposes images to show coronal loops. The loops are then analysed over time to find oscilations.

project3.py: Program for 3rd year course. Shows a small box in the convection zone of the sun. Simulates convection for a short amount of time displaying temperature and velocities.
